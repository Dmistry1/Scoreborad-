CMSC 411 Project
Darren Mirano, Deep Misty

Language: Python 3

#### Using GL ####
You can run this project on GL. 
    1.) Put scoreboard.py in the same directory as the test files. 
    2.) To run type "python3 scoreboard.py". 
    3.) Then it will ask you for a text file name. (Make sure you add the .txt)

OR 

#### Using Visual Studio Code ####
You can also run it on vsCode if you have it.
    1.) Create a folder with scoreboard.py and all of the .txt files that you would like to test
    2.) Open the scoreboard.py on vsCode
    3.) Open terminal on vsCode and navigate to the folder with scoreboard.py 
    4.) Run by typing "python3 scoreboard.py" 
    5.) Enter the file name that you would like to test (make sure to include .txt)
    6.) HAVE FUN! 

We have tested on GL and VS Code and it works. 
In reality, you can use any python3 interpreter you heart desires.

P.S We left you a EASTER EGG!! (**line 385 ;)**)
